# JocoMoto

This app scrapes articles from a popular motorcycle website. I targeted the headline, summary, and link to the article. The articles display on the main page. 

The user can then save their favorite articles. On the "Saved Articles" page the user can add notes to each specific article. 

JOCO MOTO stores the articles in a mongoDB database. It also has a Note schema that references the Article, so each note can target a specific article. 

This assignment was very challenging. I have several things I would like to do to improve this site and will be doing so in the near future. 

Thanks for visiting!
